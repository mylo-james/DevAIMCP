# Cursor Rules for DevAI MCP Server

## Process Management
- ALWAYS use `is_background: true` when starting servers, databases, or any long-running processes
- NEVER start servers in the foreground unless explicitly debugging startup issues
- Add timeouts or use background processes to avoid freezing the conversation
- When testing server startup, use background mode and then check process status separately

## Code Quality
- Fix TypeScript compilation errors before addressing linting warnings
- Use proper type annotations to avoid implicit 'any' types
- Handle undefined values properly with null checks or optional chaining
- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the codebase

## Database and Configuration
- Ensure database connections are properly configured before starting services
- Use environment variables for configuration when possible
- Handle missing dependencies gracefully with proper error messages

## Testing
- Run tests after making changes to ensure functionality is preserved
- Fix failing tests before proceeding with new features
- Use the existing test patterns and frameworks (vitest, jest)

## Error Handling
- Provide clear error messages for debugging
- Handle edge cases and potential failures gracefully
- Log errors appropriately for production environments
